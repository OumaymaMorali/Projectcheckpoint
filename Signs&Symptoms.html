      <h3>Bipolar Disorder</h3>
      <p>Manic Episode
        A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood
        and abnormally and persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy, lasting at
        least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization
        is necessary).
        B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or
        more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant
        degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:
        1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.
        2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).
        3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.
        4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.
        5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external
        stimuli), as reported or observed.
        6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or
        psychomotor agitation (i.e., puφoseless non-goal-directed activity).
        7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences
        (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or
        foolish business investments).
        C. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or
        occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others,
        or there are psychotic features.
        D. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug
        of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or to another medical condition.
        Note: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication,
        electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the
        physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and,
        therefore, a bipolar I diagnosis.
        Note: Criteria A-D constitute a manic episode. At least one lifetime manic episode is required
        for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.
        Hypomanie Episode
        A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood
        and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consecutive
        days and present most of the day, nearly every day.
        B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, three (or
        more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) have persisted, represent
        a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present to a significant
        degree:
        1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.
        2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).
        3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.
        4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.
        5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external
        stimuli), as reported or observed.
        6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or
        psychomotor agitation.
        7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences
        (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or
        foolish business investments).</p>

    <h3>Antisocial Personality Disorder</h3>
    <p>Personality is the combination of thoughts, emotions and behaviors that makes everyone unique. It's the way people view, understand and relate to the outside world, as well as how they see themselves. Personality forms during childhood, shaped through an interaction of inherited tendencies and environmental factors.

      The exact cause of antisocial personality disorder isn't known, but:
      
      Genes may make you vulnerable to developing antisocial personality disorder — and life situations may trigger its development
      Changes in the way the brain functions may have resulted during brain development. Antisocial personality disorder signs and symptoms may include:

      Disregard for right and wrong
      Persistent lying or deceit to exploit others
      Being callous, cynical and disrespectful of others
      Using charm or wit to manipulate others for personal gain or personal pleasure
      Arrogance, a sense of superiority and being extremely opinionated
      Recurring problems with the law, including criminal behavior
      Repeatedly violating the rights of others through intimidation and dishonesty
      Impulsiveness or failure to plan ahead
      Hostility, significant irritability, agitation, aggression or violence
      Lack of empathy for others and lack of remorse about harming others
      Unnecessary risk-taking or dangerous behavior with no regard for the safety of self or others
      Poor or abusive relationships
      Failure to consider the negative consequences of behavior or learn from them
      Being consistently irresponsible and repeatedly failing to fulfill work or financial obligations
      Adults with antisocial personality disorder typically show symptoms of conduct disorder before the age of 15. Signs and symptoms of conduct disorder include serious, persistent behavior problems, such as:
      
      Aggression toward people and animals
      Destruction of property
      Deceitfulness
      Theft
      Serious violation of rules
      Although antisocial personality disorder is considered lifelong, in some people, certain symptoms — particularly destructive and criminal behavior — may decrease over time. But it's not clear whether this decrease is a result of aging or an increased awareness of the consequences of antisocial behavior.</p>

    <div class="dispers">
    <h3>Dissociative Identity Disorder</h3>
    <p>Symptoms and signs of dissociative disorders include:

      Significant memory loss of specific times, people and events
      Out-of-body experiences, such as feeling as though you are watching a movie of yourself
      Mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and thoughts of suicide
      A sense of detachment from your emotions, or emotional numbness
      A lack of a sense of self-identity
      The symptoms of dissociative disorders depend on the type of disorder that has been diagnosed. There are three types of dissociative disorders defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM):
      
      Dissociative Amnesia. The main symptom is difficulty remembering important information about one’s self. Dissociative amnesia may surround a particular event, such as combat or abuse, or more rarely, information about identity and life history. The onset for an amnesic episode is usually sudden, and an episode can last minutes, hours, days, or, rarely, months or years. There is no average for age onset or percentage, and a person may experience multiple episodes throughout her life.
      Depersonalization disorder. This disorder involves ongoing feelings of detachment from actions, feelings, thoughts and sensations as if they are watching a movie (depersonalization). Sometimes other people and things may feel like people and things in the world around them are unreal (derealization). A person may experience depersonalization, derealization or both. Symptoms can last just a matter of moments or return at times over the years. The average onset age is 16, although depersonalization episodes can start anywhere from early to mid childhood. Less than 20% of people with this disorder start experiencing episodes after the age of 20.
      Dissociative identity disorder. Formerly known as multiple personality disorder, this disorder is characterized by alternating between multiple identities. A person may feel like one or more voices are trying to take control in their head. Often these identities may have unique names, characteristics, mannerisms and voices. People with DID will experience gaps in memory of every day events, personal information and trauma. Women are more likely to be diagnosed, as they more frequently present with acute dissociative symptoms. Men are more likely to deny symptoms and trauma histories, and commonly exhibit more violent behavior, rather than amnesia or fugue states. This can lead to elevated false negative diagnosis.</p>

  <div class="schizopers">
    <h3>Schizophrenia</h3>
    <p>When the disease is active, it can be characterized by episodes in which the person is unable to distinguish between real and unreal experiences. As with any illness, the severity, duration and frequency of symptoms can vary; however, in persons with schizophrenia, the incidence of severe psychotic symptoms often decreases as the person becomes older. Not taking medications as prescribed, the use of alcohol or illicit drugs, and stressful situations tend to increase symptoms. Symptoms fall into three major categories:

      Positive symptoms: (those abnormally present) Hallucinations, such as hearing voices or seeing things that do not exist, paranoia and exaggerated or distorted perceptions, beliefs and behaviors.
      Negative symptoms: (those abnormally absent) A loss or a decrease in the ability to initiate plans, speak, express emotion or find pleasure.
      Disorganized symptoms: Confused and disordered thinking and speech, trouble with logical thinking and sometimes bizarre behavior or abnormal movements.
      Cognition is another area of functioning that is affected in schizophrenia leading to problems with attention, concentration and memory, and to declining educational performance.
      
      Symptoms of schizophrenia usually first appear in early adulthood and must persist for at least six months for a diagnosis to be made. Men often experience initial symptoms in their late teens or early 20s while women tend to show first signs of the illness in their 20s and early 30s. More subtle signs may be present earlier, including troubled relationships, poor school performance and reduced motivation.
      
      Before a diagnosis can be made, however, a psychiatrist should conduct a thorough medical examination to rule out substance misuse or other neurological or medical illnesses whose symptoms mimic schizophrenia.</p>

  <div class="PTSDpers">
    <h3>Post-traumatic Stress Disorder</h3>
    <p>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that may occur in people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event such as a natural disaster, a serious accident, a terrorist act, war/combat, or rape or who have been threatened with death, sexual violence or serious injury.

      PTSD has been known by many names in the past, such as “shell shock” during the years of World War I and “combat fatigue” after World War II, but PTSD does not just happen to combat veterans. PTSD can occur in all people, of any ethnicity, nationality or culture, and at any age. PTSD affects approximately 3.5 percent of U.S. adults every year, and an estimated one in 11 people will be diagnosed with PTSD in their lifetime. Women are twice as likely as men to have PTSD. Three ethnic groups – U.S. Latinos, African Americans, and American Indians – are disproportionately affected and have higher rates of PTSD than non-Latino whites.
      
      People with PTSD have intense, disturbing thoughts and feelings related to their experience that last long after the traumatic event has ended. They may relive the event through flashbacks or nightmares; they may feel sadness, fear or anger; and they may feel detached or estranged from other people. People with PTSD may avoid situations or people that remind them of the traumatic event, and they may have strong negative reactions to something as ordinary as a loud noise or an accidental touch.
      
      A diagnosis of PTSD requires exposure to an upsetting traumatic event. However, the exposure could be indirect rather than first hand. For example, PTSD could occur in an individual learning about the violent death of a close family or friend. It can also occur as a result of repeated exposure to horrible details of trauma such as police officers exposed to details of child abuse cases. Symptoms of PTSD fall into four categories. Specific symptoms can vary in severity.

      Intrusion: Intrusive thoughts such as repeated, involuntary memories; distressing dreams; or flashbacks of the traumatic event. Flashbacks may be so vivid that people feel they are re-living the traumatic experience or seeing it before their eyes.
      Avoidance: Avoiding reminders of the traumatic event may include avoiding people, places, activities, objects and situations that may trigger distressing memories. People may try to avoid remembering or thinking about the traumatic event. They may resist talking about what happened or how they feel about it.
      Alterations in cognition and mood: Inability to remember important aspects of the traumatic evet, negative thoughts and feelings leading to ongoing and distorted beliefs about oneself or others (e.g., “I am bad,” “No one can be trusted”); distorted thoughts about the cause or consequences of the event leading to wrongly blaming self or other; ongoing fear, horror, anger, guilt or shame; much less interest in activities previously enjoyed; feeling detached or estranged from others; or being unable to exprience positive emotions (a void of happiness or satisfation).
      Alterations in arousal and reactivity: Arousal and reactive symptoms may include being irritable and having angry outbursts; behaving recklessly or in a self-destructive way; being overly watchful of one's surroundings in a suspecting way; being easily startled; or having problems concentrating or sleeping.</p>
